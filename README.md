Couchpotato-SabNZBD-AntiVirus
=============================

This is a post-processing script for sabnzbd that checks downloaded files for virusses, and tells that to CP afterwards

Credits for the 90% 'not-Couchpotato-part' of this script go to "sander", one of the release testers of SabNZBd

Edited to work with Virustotal V2 API 

Currently couchpotato signalling is broken, either use SABnzbd 0.8 wich sets downloads to failed on non zero exits or supply me a patch ;)
